    lum "Over here is where you three will be uh,"
    lum "er..."
    lum "sleeping."

    s "Why would a guy like you have three extra beds? You don't have much need for them it seems."

    lum "I used to have three kids at one time or another, but they've all moved on now."

    "Theres a pause that hangs in the air a little too long."

    z "So you've kept them."

    lum "Yeah. It's been a long while since I last saw them. It's not like the old days anymore."

    "It's dark and quiet and as I'm all tucked in, warm and comfortable, my rest is disturbed by the sounds of some sniffling"

    s "Do you guys smell iron?"

    z "I think he has an iron axe."

    s "It smells like its in the air. I don't know how to explain it."

    e "Now that you mention it, I smell it too. It's like a mixture of smoke and iron."

    s "Yeah..."

    z "Ok, so he has an iron furnace, so what?"

    s "Don't you remember? He said he has a stone furnace."

    z "Maybe he forges his own tools?"

    s "Have you seen the tools he uses? Those aren't new by any means."

    z "Well I don't know what it is Stella. What do you think it is then?"

    s "How should I know? I just think its really weird."

    e "Didn't he say he was burning dense wood?"

    s "I think so, but if we smell iron, then what is that guy up to?"

    "Another silence, I brace myself for what stellas about to say next"

    s "I think we should investigate."

    "And there it is"

    e "I'll go if you go."

    z "Really guys? The lumberjack was kind enough to let us in his own home!"
    z "It doesn't feel right to snoop around."

    s "It's not snooping. It's investigating."

    "I let out a long sigh"

    z "There's no stopping you, is there?"

    s "Nope."
    s "So are you coming or not?"

    z "I guess I am. I'll have to admit, I {i}am{/i} a bit skeptical of the lumberjack...but for a different reason."
    z "I told him about my pendant today and, just for a split second, he looked like he knew what it was... or rather who {i}I{/i} was."

    "Our disscusion is cut short when we hear a voice from the neighboring room."

    lum "Sanjay, Sucrose, Samantha...Is my name Samantha?"
    lum "..."
    lum "No, no, no that can't be right."
    lum "Uh, Larry. Larry the lumberjack...no..."
    lum "Cymbal, Cyanide, Cranial... I feel I'm close. Hmmm..."
