    "Elliot hands a glass of water to Stella"

    e "Here you go Stella"

    s "...Thanks"

    lum "I'll show you to your rooms for the night."
    "The large man opens a nearby door and gestures inside"
    lum "Over here is where you three will be..,"
    lum "Er..."
    lum "Sleeping."

    s "Why would a guy like you have three extra beds? You don't have much need for them it seems."

    lum "I used to have three kids at one time or another, but they've all moved on now."

    "Theres a pause that hangs in the air a little too long."

    z "So you've kept them."

    lum "Yeah. It's been a long while since I last saw them. It's not like the old days anymore."

    #Missing Dialogue from zach here
    z "..."

    e "It's getting pretty hot in here."

    lum "My apologies, my stone furnace is working overtime. I've been burning pretty dense wood."
    lum "You may crack a window if you like."
    lum "That reminds me I have some errands to run quickly. I won't be out too long."

    "And with that, the man is out of the cabin before we can get another word in, we decide to take advantage of his hospitality and get some rest"

    "It's dark and quiet and as I'm all tucked in, warm and comfortable, my rest is disturbed by the sounds of some sniffling"

    s "Do you guys smell iron?"

    z "I think he has an iron axe."

    s "It smells like its in the air. I don't know how to explain it."

    e "Now that you mention it, I smell it too. It's like a mixture of smoke and iron."

    s "Yeah..."

    z "Ok, so he has an iron furnace, so what?"

    s "Don't you remember? He said he has a stone furnace."

    z "Maybe he forges his own tools?"

    s "Have you seen the tools he uses? Those aren't new by any means."

    z "Well I don't know what it is Stella. What do you think it is then?"

    s "How should I know? I just think its really weird."

    e "Didn't he say he was burning dense wood?"

    s "I think so, but if we smell iron, then what is that guy up to?"

    "Another silence, I brace myself for what stellas about to say next"

    s "I think we should investigate."

    "And there it is"

    e "I'll go if you go."

    z "Really guys? The lumberjack was kind enough to let us in his own home!"
    z "It doesn't feel right to snoop around."

    s "It's not snooping. It's investigating."

    "I let out a long sigh"

    z "There's no stopping you, is there?"

    s "Nope."
    s "So are you coming or not?"

    z "I guess I am. I'll have to admit, I {i}am{/i} a bit skeptical of the lumberjack...but for a different reason."
    z "I told him about my pendant today and, just for a split second, he looked like he knew what it was... or rather who {i}I{/i} was."

    "Our disscusion is cut short when we hear a voice from the neighboring room."

    lum "Sanjay, Sucrose, Samantha...Is my name Samantha?"
    lum "..."
    lum "No, no, no that can't be right."
    lum "Uh, Larry. Larry the lumberjack...no..."
    lum "Cymbal, Cyanide, Cranial... I feel I'm close. Hmmm..."

    s "What is he mumbling about now? Doesn't he know what time it is?"

    z "Like you should be talking, we're still awake."

    e "Don't know, but he's been stuck on this one for a while."

    lum "I think it starts with a C, *sigh* I just can't remember. I'm sorry {b}{i}Hazel.{/i}{/b} I'm struggling on this one."

    z "{b}{i}Hazel!?{/i}{/b} Whose {b}{i}Hazel?{/i}{/b}"

    e "I don't know, but I don't want to stay and find out."

    s "Get back here. You're not going anywhere until we find out what's going on."
    s "Let's wait an hour or so until things calm down, then we'll strike."

    z "Jeez Stella, you make it sound like we're hitmen or something."

    s "I mean Elliot's basically a hitman already. Have you seen him? You, on the other hand are dog food."

    e "The good kind or the bad kind?"

    s "..."
    s "The what?"

    e "The dog food. Is he the good kind or the bad kind?"

    s "There's a good king?"

    e "Of course there is."

    s "Uh...the bad kind...I guess?"
    s "Anyways, like I said, you're dog food."

    z "So, I'm bait?"

    s "Precisely. Only if we run into a problem that is."

    z "Lovely."

    z "ready."

    s "Okay. Lets move out!"

    z "Are we sure we wanna do this?"

    s "Yeah, are you?"

    z "I guess so, we've come this far."
