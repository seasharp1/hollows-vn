    z "Alright,"
    z "Wow! This is tough. Do you do this everytime you want water?"

    lum "Yes sir! I always bring 2 large buckets to fill at a time so I can make fewer trips to the well."

    z "I don't know how anyone could live like this."

    lum "So what brought you to Timberland? If it's anything like I remember, it's not a tourist destination by any means."
    lum "So you must have a reason."

    z "No. I mean... I have a family, but I'm adopted. I was really curious to see what my biological family was like,
    but I don't even know how to find them."
    z "After visting town, it seemed like no one could really help me."

    lum "Oh? Well what..."
    lum "Uh..."
    lum "CLUES! That's the word. What clues do you have?"

    z "I just know that my parents were from Timberland. Also, they left me with this pendent."

    lum "Oh I see. *{i}surpised{/i}*"

    z "Have you seen this before?"

    lum "Uh...no, I don't think I have. (no longer acting suprised to hide feelings)"
    lum "Well, we should be getting back. We don't want to leave the girl thirsty forever."
